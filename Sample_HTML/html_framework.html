    <h3>Here is a basic framework for writing an application portfolio for yourself</h3>

    <h4>Your website portfolio</h4>
    <p> You will build a portfolio of applications that demonstrates your newfound
    prowess as a front-end web developer. </p>

    <p> You will then have the skills to add to your portfolio and understand the finer
      points of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
      
    <p> One of the key elements of the portfolio is understanding the '&lt table>' tag
      in HTML. Here is a good place to learn more about it. Take 5 minutes, you'll
      get it pretty quick.</p>

      <ul></ul>

	  
	<p> By the time you finish this semester we will create at least 4 different applications
		to add to your website. These will be a great way for you to show off your website as 
		a portfolio, and a glimpse into your abilities as a programmer.</p>

					<p> My name is Marlena Hansen, and I am a 4th year at the University of Cincinnati. I am currently studying Information Systems at the Lindner College of Business. In May 2016, I will be graduating with a Bachelor's of Business Administration in Information Systems from the University of Cincinnati. </p>
					<p> During my time at the University of Cincinnati, I held several Co-op positions. My first position was at Medical Reimbursment Inc. (MRI) as an Information Technology intern. There, I did a lot of database management and query writing. After that, I went to GE Aviation as an ITLP Intern. In this position, I was a web development intern, and I worked closely with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Amazon Web Services, and Chef. After that position, I moved onto Gensuite LLC. There, I was a Business Analyst intern and a Product Developer Intern. In this role I did a lot of web development in ColdFusion (don't waste your time learning this language). And finally, I returned to GE Aviation as and ITLP Intern. In my final role, I was a Project Manager Intern. I managed several IT projects and did development and efficiency scripting in Python. I will be returning to GE Aviation as a full time ITLP employee this July. </p>
					<p>I was born and raised in Cincinnati, and I went to Ursuline for high school. I have three brothers, and many many cousins. I spent my first year at UC in the DAAP program studying Industrial Design. I really enjoy art and design, however, I quickly realized I want nothing to do with being a designer. Because of that, I switched into Information Systems. I love to ski and snow sports in general... other than that I have run out of things to say, so I'm just going to repeat this paragraph... </p>

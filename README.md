# Sample_Applications

JavaScript is a language that is used to manipulate webpages and content on web pages.

JavaScript can be used in several ways. One, you use the <script></script> tags in HTML and put the JavaScript in there.

The other option is to write the JavaScript in a seperate .js file and then use the <script></script> tags to call (referencing another file and its functionality) that script into the HTML file.

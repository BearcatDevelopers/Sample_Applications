Ruby is a "dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language."(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_\(programming_language)) It has an elegant (read: really easy) syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Although it is commonly used to perform tasks similar to python, it also has a built-in web application delivery system called Ruby on Rails (RoR). RoR allows you to write a web application and have Ruby handle everything else. Though I do not have much experience with RoR, I have a grasp of all of the pieces (HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby) that would allow me to build one.

Ruby is run from the command line/prompt in the directory that the file is stored. However, you need to add a PATH variable so you can run ruby commands in the command line/prompt. We'll cover all of that.

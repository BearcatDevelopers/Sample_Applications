Welcome to Python!

According to http://www.python.org/, python is a powerful object-oriented open-source language similar to other languages such as Perl, Scheme, Java, or Ruby.

It can run on many computers and operating systems and is very easy to read and use. Many users believe it's more "human friendly" than other languages.

Although its main purpose is to work quickly and integrate systems more effectively, which is related to more back-end scripting and functions, it can also integrate into different web-based frameworks in order to write web applications.

Although you can write it anywhere, Python is run in its own shell (command prompt); You will need to download it in order to run any python scripts you write.

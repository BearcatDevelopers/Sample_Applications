    <h1>Hello Bearcat Developers!</h1>

    <h2>My name is Dan Billmann and I am <u><i>Bearcat Developers' Supreme Overlord!</i></u> </h2>

    <p>Just kidding! I am one of the founders along with my good friend and former co-worker Marlena Hansen. </p>

    <p>This page will help you get to know me a little bit better as well as teach you about HTML.</p>

    <p>First thing you should know is I am also a beginner. I have a year's head-start on the greenest people here and have logged several hundred hours (mostly with ruby) trying to learn on my own. </p>
    <p>That being said, I am trying to learn as much as possible from all of you as some of you are trying to learn from me.</p>
    <p>Many of those hours were spent trying to fix stupid syntax errors instead of focusing on how to solve problems using code.</p>
    <p>Here's a breakdown by my strength and familiarity with each programming language I know:</p>

    <p>In this file I am using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). Honestly, I really don't like using CSS. I am more interested in the functionality of programming
rather than the look and feel of it. I prefer to get the right output than to make the output pretty. However, I have dusted off some cobwebs to re-learn enough to teach some of the basics.</p>
